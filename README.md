# Iris dataset(Logistic Regression)
This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). 
- Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.
There are 150 observations with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). There are no null values, so we don't have to worry about that. There are 50 observations of each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

## Problem: Predict the class of the flower based on available attributes.
I have used Logistic Regression to predict the class of the flower based on its available attributes
